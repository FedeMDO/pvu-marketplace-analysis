Analysis of PVU Plants posted on Marketplace
Create a list of plants ordered by ROI and PRICE

ROI = NFT_PRICE_IN_PVU / PVU_PROFIT_PER_DAY

## Envs
Create an .env file (check ```.env.example```)
You can get your token inspecting the request made on PVU marketplace (F12, Network, make a request and find your token on request headers)
You will need to enter LE to PVU Rate (```AVG_PVU_COST_FROM_LE``` env)
Devs changes it all the time so you should keep it up to date

## Install
```npm install```

## Run
```npm start```

Check "output.txt"
